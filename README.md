# Feature-Engineering

Project Overview
In this notebook, the goal is to test a few machine learning models to see how well they perform on a classification task. We’re trying different ways of selecting the most important features from the dataset and then using those features to train models. The models we’ll be testing are Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Trees. We’ll also evaluate their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and visualize the results.

1. Importing Libraries
We start by importing the libraries that we’ll need. These include:

*pandas and numpy for data handling.
*scikit-learn for machine learning models, feature selection, and evaluation metrics.
*matplotlib and seaborn for plotting and visualizing results.

2. Loading the Data
Next, we load the dataset using pandas. We assume that the dataset is in CSV format, and we use the read_csv function to load it into a DataFrame. Once the data is loaded, we can inspect it and get an idea of its structure.

3. Data Preprocessing
Here, we separate the dataset into features (X) and target labels (y). Features are the columns that our models will use to make predictions, while target labels are the actual categories or classes that we’re trying to predict. After that, we split the data into training and testing sets. Usually, we use 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing to check how well the model performs on unseen data.

4. Feature Selection
In this section, we try different ways of selecting the most important features from the dataset. The idea is to reduce the number of features to make the models faster and potentially more accurate by focusing only on the most relevant information.

a. Chi-Squared Test:
We use the Chi-Squared test to rank features based on their relevance to the target variable. This test checks how much the feature values are related to the target labels.

b. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE):
RFE works by recursively eliminating the least important features. It trains the model, removes the weakest feature, and repeats the process until we’re left with the most important ones.

c. Random Forest Feature Importance:
Random Forest is a model that can also tell us how important each feature is based on how often it was used to make splits in the trees during training.

5. Training the Models
Now that we’ve selected the most important features, it’s time to train our models. We’re using three different models:

a. Naive Bayes:
This model is based on probability and is quite simple but often effective, especially when the features are independent of each other.

b. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
KNN is a straightforward model that looks at the k closest points to a new data point and classifies it based on which class is the most common among those neighbors.

c. Decision Tree:
A Decision Tree is a model that splits the data into branches based on feature values, making decisions at each branch to classify the data.

6. Evaluating the Models
Once the models are trained, we need to evaluate how well they perform. We use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to get a sense of how good the models are at making predictions.

Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions.
Precision: The proportion of positive predictions that are actually correct.
Recall: How many of the actual positives we were able to identify.
F1-Score: A balanced measure that considers both precision and recall.
a. Accuracy:
b. Confusion Matrix:
A confusion matrix helps us see where the model made errors, showing the breakdown of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
The same steps are repeated for the KNN and Decision Tree models to evaluate their performance.

7. Comparing the Models
After training and evaluating the models, we compare their performance across the different feature selection methods (Chi2, RFE, RF) to see which model and method give the best results. We store the results in a pandas DataFrame for easy comparison.

8. Visualizing the Results
Finally, we plot the performance metrics using bar charts to get a visual comparison of how the models perform.

Summary
This notebook walks through how to:

*Load and preprocess a dataset for machine learning.
*Apply different feature selection techniques (Chi2, RFE, Random Forest).
*Train and evaluate three different models: Naive Bayes, KNN, and Decision Tree.
*Compare their performance using key metrics.
*Visualize the results to see which model and feature selection method performs best.
